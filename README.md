# Project Import Cargo Management

## Description:

This project was developed as part of the Information Technology Analyst program at ORT Uruguay University, during the Programming 1 course. It was built in collaboration with a classmate.

The system is designed to manage import cargo in containers arriving in Uruguay on cargo ships. It provides functionalities for both importers and shipping companies, enabling them to:

- Register and log in as an importer or a shipping company.
- Submit and track cargo requests for importers.
- Assign ships and manage shipments for shipping companies.
- Monitor pending requests and statistical data to optimize logistics.

The project was developed using JavaScript and HTML, focusing on an interactive front-end experience with dynamic UI updates through DOM manipulation.
